        <p>SneakersRUS was created in 2019 by Joseph, AJ and Jefferson. The vision of SneakersRUS is to celebrate the rich culture of sneakers. We created this company because we felt there wasnt a sneaker company out there who fully encouraged the love of sneakers. We want to create a community who feel comfortable to express their passion for sneakers. We thrive to accomplish this by providing the hottest sneakers on the market and also by shining a light on unkwown sneakers.</p>

        <p>Whether its for casual wear or for high intesity sports we can guarantee we will deliver on your needs. With the technology of sneakers being improved everyday we aim to contribute in shaping the future of sneakers. We recognise we are a small company in a very competitive market but we accept the challenges with this as we proudly fight everyday to be a voice for sneaker fans across the world. Now you know who we are and what we're fighting for, we hope to see you in one of our stores soon to be a part of accomplishing our vision. </p>
